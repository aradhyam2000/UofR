1. Consider random variables $X$ and $Y$. Calculate $Var(3X+2Y)$ given the 
following information. (Hint: At some point, you may need to use the fact 
that variance cannot be negative.)

    * $E(3X+2) = 8$
    * $E(4X+2Y) = 14$
    * $E(2Y(X+1)) = 28$

6. Suppose that we are interested in the length of time before the next
lightning strike. There are three types of lightning we are interested in: 
cloud-to-ground ($G$), cloud-to-air ($A$), and cloud-to-cloud ($C$). For all 
types of lightning, the length of time before the next strike is distributed 
according to an exponential distribution, but the exponential distribution has
a different parameter for each type of lightning. In particular, $\lambda_{G} = 2$,
$\lambda_{A} = 0.6$, and $\lambda_{C} = 0.1$.

    a. On a single plot, visualize the PDFs over the range $x \in [0, 10]$ for
    each of these exponential distributions. It may be helpful to use the 
    function ``dexp" in R. 
    
```{r}
curve(dexp(x,rate=2),from=0, to=10, lwd=2, col='red', ylab = "Probability Density") 
curve(dexp(x,rate=0.6),from=0, to=10, lwd=2, col='blue', add = TRUE) 
curve(dexp(x,rate=0.1),from=0, to=10, lwd=2, col='green', add = TRUE)
legend('bottomright',inset=0.05,c("Ground","Air","Cloud"),lty=1,col=c("red","blue","green"))
```
    
    
    b. What are $E(G)$, $E(A)$, and $E(C)$, as well as $Var(G)$, $Var(A)$,
    and $Var(C)$?
```{r}
lam_g = 2
lam_a = 0.6
lam_c = 0.1
Eg = 1/lam_g
Ea = 1/lam_a
Ec = 1/lam_c
VarG = 1/(lam_g)^2
VarA = 1/(lam_a)^2
VarC = 1/(lam_c)^2

Eg
Ea
Ec

VarG
VarA 
VarC

```
$E(G)$ = 0.5 , $E(A)$ = 1.666667, and $E(C)$ =10
$Var(G)$ = 0.25, $Var(A)$=2.777778, and $Var(C)$=100
    
    c. Suppose that we repeatedly sample collections of $n = 100$ observations 
    from the distribution of cloud-to-ground ($G$) lightning strike timings. 
    What is the mean and variance of this sample distribution? 
    
```{r}
ans = rexp(100, rate=2)
mean(ans)
var(ans)
```
   
    
```{r}
#Considering lambda for cloud-to-ground.
lamG = 2
varG = 1/(lamG)^2
varG
meanG = 1/lamG
meanG
n=100
Sample_Variance = varG/n
Sample_Variance
```
    
    
    d. Now, let us examine the empirical sampling distribution of cloud-to-ground
    ($G$) lightning. For each value of $n = \{10, 100, 1000\}$, sample $n$ points
    from the exponential distribution from $G$ a grand total of $m = 5000$ times,
    and record the mean of each sample. You should end up with three different 
    sets of 5000 sample means. For each of these sets, report the sample mean 
    and sample standard deviation. Comment on how the observed values line up 
    with what you would expect in theory. It may be useful to use the R function
    ``rexp()".
```{r}
#For n = 10
set.seed(5000 *10)
ss10 = NULL
for (i in 1:5000) {
  ss10 <- c(ss10 , mean(rexp(10,2)))
}
mean(ss10)
sd(ss10)
hist(ss10, main="Histogram for n=10", xlab="n=10", col="bisque")
```

```{r}
#For n = 100
set.seed(5000 *100)
ss100 = NULL
for (i in 1:5000) {
  ss100 <- c(ss100 , mean(rexp(100,2)))
}
mean(ss100)
sd(ss100)
hist(ss100, main="Histogram for n=100", xlab="n=100", col="bisque")
```


```{r}
#For n = 1000
set.seed(5000 *1000)
ss1000 = NULL
for (i in 1:5000) {
  ss1000 <- c(ss1000 , mean(rexp(1000,2)))
}
mean(ss1000)
sd(ss1000)
hist(ss1000, main="Histogram for n=1000", xlab="n=1000", col="bisque")
```
For n=10 the histogram is skewed and according to the theory we know for n<30,
shape won't be normal. As the n increases to 100 and 1000, we can observed 
shape of distribution is normal.
Also we know that further the population is from normal, the larger the sample
size we require to ensure normality of the sampling distribution. Here, we have 
taken random population so it will require large sample size like n=100 and 1000 
to ensure normality of sampling distribution.
Also, we can observe that sd is decreases as n increasesas n increases which means 
increase in accuracy. Also theoretical mean was 0.50 which is almost equal to
mean we got from 3 histograms. For n=1000, we observed bimodal histogram.

7. Suppose that we would like to get an idea of how much coffee is consumed by 
the entire University of Rochester each day. We take a sample of 100 days and 
find that the average amount of coffee consumed by the University of Rochester
per day is 580 gallons. 

    a. Assume that coffee consumption comes from a normal distribution with
    $\sigma = 90$. Find a two-sided 95% confidence interval for the average
    amount of coffee consumed by the University of Rochester each day.
    
    b. Assuming the same information as part a, suppose that we now only want a
    upper-bound confidence interval. Calculate a one-sided 95% upper-bound 
    confidence interval for the average amount of coffee consumed by the
    University of Rochester each day.
    
    c. Now, suppose that we do not know the variance of the true distribution of
    coffee consumption. However, in our sample, we see that $s = 80$. 
    Find a two-sided 95% confidence interval for the average amount of coffee
    consumed by the University of Rochester each day.
    
    d. Assuming the same information as part c, suppose that we now only want a 
    upper-bound confidence interval. Calculate a one-sided 95% upper-bound 
    confidence interval for the average amount of coffee consumed by the 
    University of Rochester each day.
    
    e. Assuming the same information as part a (i.e., known population variance),
    calculate the number of samples needed in order to get a two-sided 95% 
    confidence interval for the average amount of coffee consumed by the 
    University of Rochester each day of length 16.
